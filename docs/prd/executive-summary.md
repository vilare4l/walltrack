# Executive Summary

WallTrack is a personal trading intelligence system for exploiting on-chain alpha in Solana memecoin markets through intelligent wallet copy-trading. The system addresses a fundamental market inefficiency: memecoin trading is an insider's game, and existing copy-trading solutions extract excessive value through fees while offering zero transparency or granular control.

The core value proposition combines manual wallet curation with automated execution—providing control + efficiency without the overhead of manual trading or the opacity of commercial bots. The operator (Christophe) curates a watchlist of high-performing wallets discovered via GMGN, receives real-time swap notifications via Helius webhooks, validates wallet quality in simulation mode before risking capital, and executes automated copy-trades with customizable exit strategies.

WallTrack transforms memecoin trading from an inaccessible insider game into a systematic, transparent, and controllable operation—retaining 100% of profits while building permanent skills in Solana/DeFi infrastructure.

### What Makes This Special

**Zero-Fee Intelligent Copy Trading with Progressive Validation**

The unique combination of capabilities not available in existing solutions:

1. **Cost Structure**: Zero fees = 100% profit retention vs. 0.5-1% per trade on commercial bots (significant savings at scale)

2. **Transparency**: Open code with full visibility into decision logic vs. black box systems—complete system mastery instead of blind trust

3. **Progressive Risk Management**: Per-wallet simulation mode validates quality before risking capital vs. all-or-nothing live trading on commercial platforms

4. **Strategy Customization**: Exit strategies per wallet + per-position overrides vs. fixed strategies—adapt to wallet behavior patterns

5. **Operator Control**: Daily high-level curation (watchlist management, strategy adjustments) without manual trading vs. either set-and-forget or unsustainable manual effort

6. **Performance Intelligence**: Win rate and signal analytics per wallet for data-driven watchlist management vs. no granular tracking

**The Insider Edge Made Accessible**: By copying proven smart money wallets in real-time with custom strategies, WallTrack exploits the same insider edge that drives memecoin markets—but with complete control, zero fees, and progressive validation from simulation to profitable live trading.

**Development Advantage**: Claude Code and AI assistance make building sophisticated trading infrastructure accessible to solo technical operators—a capability that didn't exist 12 months ago.
